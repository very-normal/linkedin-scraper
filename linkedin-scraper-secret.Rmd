# Purpose of Notebook

An easier interface to run code quicker in a notebook. 

```{r, message = F, warning = F}
library(RSelenium)
library(tidyverse)
source("helpers.R")

# This needs to be run before the scraper can be run
rD = rsDriver(browser = "firefox")
remDr = rD$client
```

Make sure that you update the information according to your personal profile!

```{r}
# Scraping function needs
# 1. keyword: keyword to search for in job title
# 2. username: LinkedIn username
# 3. password: LinkedIn password
# 4. maxpages (optional): maximum number of pages to scrape, default NULL
# 5. verbose (optional): should progress be printed?
scrapePostingsForKeyword(keyword = "biostatistician",
                         username = "chris.b.pascual@gmail.com",
                         password = "ghjkl012993",
                         start = 2)
```

```{r}
# Remember to close down the Selenium server
rD$server$stop()
```
